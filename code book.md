#CODEBOOK

This codebook illustrates the variables in file "output". This file is the combination of seven original files, as discussed in the README file. It is produced by the R script available in this repository.

Information on those original files can be found in the README of the authors of the dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

This file contains two types of variables: identifiers (factor variables that identify the subjectID\pair) and features (numerical variables measuring one aspect of the subject performance).

The identifiers are the following:
subjectID. This factor variable contains the number identifying each of the 30 volunteers who were part of the study. The variables goes from 1 to 30.
activity. This factor variable contains the name of the activity. It takes six values: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying.

The features are variables 3 to 68. Each of these 66 numerical variables measures the value of select measurements taken during the study. These variables are the following:
